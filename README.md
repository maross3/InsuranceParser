I found it really hard to find mental health help while on Medicaid. I decided to make it easier to find a good health care provider by parsing the insurance company's directory and serving it via google maps. 

Under very early development. Rough future plans:
* autocomplete
* zoom to input area code
* descriptive popups that provide ratings, speacialty, phone number, website, address, ect.
* convert to RoR application (?)
